Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is commonly used for projects with multiple collaborators where 
	it would be helpful to keep track of edit history. In addition, having
	multiple branches allows programmers to work on separate features
	simultaneously and merge them when ready, as well as to isolate issues
	to one part of the project and make debugging easier. In a classroom
	setting, Git would be helpful in backing up projects, hosting 
	group projects, and keeping track of bugs.
