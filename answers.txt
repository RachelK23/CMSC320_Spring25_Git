Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is commonly used for projects with multiple collaborators where 
	it would be helpful to keep track of edit history. In addition, having
	multiple branches allows programmers to work on separate features
	simultaneously and merge them when ready, as well as to isolate issues
	to one part of the project and make debugging easier. In a classroom
	setting, Git would be helpful in backing up projects, hosting 
	group projects, and keeping track of bugs.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Healthcare is a field with many data science applications. For example,
	patient data can be used for disease prevention and genomics.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Git merge creates an additional commit to merge two branches together. Git rebase creates a more linear commit 
	history by updating the start of your branch to a different commit; it does not create a new commit in the
	process.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking forward to hanging out with my friends and learning new content in my CS classes, especially
	this class. I'm currently on the data science track, so hopefully this class will expand my knowledge
	of the data science field and inspire me to take more related courses.â‰ˆ
